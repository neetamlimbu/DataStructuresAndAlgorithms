### Tree
Trees are non linear data structures and are used in various applications like databases, websites, GUI and so on. They are by definition recursive data structures and constucting them with recursion is far more intuitive.

1. Implement Binary tree (Solution)
2. Implement Binary tree using array input (Solution)

**Building tree using array input**

Input: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100

Desired Output of complete binary tree

                 10                               
              /       \
           20           30
          /   \        /   \
        40     50    60    70
       /  \    /
    80    90  100

A pattern emerges, for a node with index i:

                  0                               
              /       \
            1            2
          /   \        /   \
         3      4     5     6
       /  \    /
     7     8  9

- The left child has index of 2*i + 1   => 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- The right child has index of 2*i + 2  => 2, 4, 6, 8

With the base case for recursion

`i >= input.length`
